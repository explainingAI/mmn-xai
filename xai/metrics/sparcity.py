""" Module for calculating sparcity of a matrix.

Sparcity is proposed by T. Gomez et al. as an auxiliary metric for evaluating the quality of a
saliency map. In the original paper is defined as S=Smax / Smean, where Smax is the maximum value
of the saliency map and Smean is the mean value of the saliency map. This definition is converted
to S=1/Smean, when the saliency map is normalized between 0 and 1.
